A File to show how to work on Git and GitHub(BASICS):
Step1)	install git.
	$git
	Now you willl be listed with step how to install git.
Step2)	$git config --global user.name "USER_NAME"
Step3)	$git config --global user.email "USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
Step4)	$mkdir Any_Directory
Step5)	$git init Any_Directory
Step6)	$cd Any_Directory
Step7)	$git status
Step8)	Put anything(.txt, .jpeg, .jpg etc) in the Directory you have created by name "Any_Directory" and then follow the following steps.
Step9)	$git add .
Step10)	$git status
Step11)	$git commit -m "Any_Message_You_Want_To_Pass_to_user_who_is_going_to_check_your_file"
Step12)	$git log	#To check all the logs of the files and there updation details.
Step13)	$git diff	#To check what is the difference between the successful commits.
Step14)	Now in the following steps we will genrate a public key to work online with github.com
Step15)	$ssh-keygen -t rsa	#To generate a ssh key
	Don't Add anything at the place of "File wher you want to store a key". However do "add a PASSPHRASE". You will be asked for 
	the passpahrase later at GitHub.com.
	
Step16)	To check the status of key you have generated:	$ssh git@github.com
	At 'root' $ls -a	Here you will get a hidden directory ".ssh" in which your ssh key will be stored in the file id_rsa.pub.
	$ cd /.ssh
	$ls -l		
	$cat id_rsa.pub
	Now copy the ssh key thus shown and follow the folloeing procedure.
Step17) Now copy the key thus generated from /.ssh/id_rsa.pub file and got to your account on github and create a repository over there
	And then go to your account settings, ssh keys, and Add the key there by pasting the key you have created in .ssh/ .pub file
	and giving a title to your key.
Step18)	Go to the directory you have created on github.com
	Directory you have created on Github.com (on opening) will be given with a http, ssh,& Git read-only address.
	Copy the ssh address from there and follow the following procedure for various git options and commits.(Currently this procedure 
	is only for 'commit' and push option on Github.com)

Step19)	$git remote add		Directory_name_you've_created_On_GitHub.com	SSH_ADDRESS_Of_THAT_DIRECTORY_FROM_GitHub.com
Step20)	$git push 	File_You've_Creted_In_Your_Local_Git_Directory	master
	(master indicates that you are working on the master brach of your local git.)
	In case you get any rejection error, do $ git merge File_In_Your_Loca_Git/master
	This will actually change your local file to your master branch.
	

These steps illustrate how to work on github and git USING LINUX.
