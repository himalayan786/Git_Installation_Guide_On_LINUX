A File to show how to work on Git and GitHub(BASICS):
Step1)	install git.
	$git
	Now you willl be listed with step how to install git.
Step2)	$git config --global user.name "USER_NAME"
Step3)	$git config --global user.email "USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
Step4)	$mkdir Any_Directory
Step5)	$git init Any_Directory
Step6)	$cd Ay_Directory
Step7)	$git status
Step8)	Put anything in the Directory you have created by name "Any_Directory" and then follow the following steps.
Step9)	$git add .
Step10)	$git status
Step11)	$git commit -m "Any_Message_You_Want_To_Pass_to_user_who_is_going_to_check_your_file"
Step12)	$git log
Step13)	$git diff
Step14)	Now in the following steps we will genrate a public key to work online with github.com
Step15)	$ssh-keygen -t rsa	
	Don't Add anything at the place of "File wher you want to store a key". However do "add a PASSPHRASE". You will be asked for 
	the passpahrase.
Step16)	To check the status of key you have generated:	$ssh git@github.com
Step17) Now copy the key thus generated from .ssh/key.pub file and got to your account on github and create a repository over there
	And then go to your account settings, ssh keys, and Add the key there by pasting the key you have created in .ssh/ .pub file
	and giving a title to your key.
These steps illustrate how to work on github and git USING LINUX.
